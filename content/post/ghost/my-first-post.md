"welcome to my page. My name is Anthony D Simmons. I am a software engineer and this is the Ghost Engine. This is where I post technical write ups and go over the process of learning programming. As well as walking through my old code. I hope you enjoy watching my grow and become a better engineer"


```
class Stack():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
        print(self.items)
    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
    def popper(self):
        self.items.pop()
```
This week I learned about the stack data type. Basically, it is a list that takes in data through a list of items and stacks them on top of each other. It can only stack or remove from the top. It does not remove from the bottom of the list or middle. Which allows this data type to reach O(N) terms of speed. This is the one of the first data types I have learned this week. Let's break down what we could do with this, we could make a undo and redo button. Back and forward. This is something I can explore when building apps and sites. 

Thank you for joining my quest to learn. I will be going over Queue data structure later on.
